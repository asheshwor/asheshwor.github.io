        <ol>
          <li>Design a mixed-method study to evaluate human-environment interactions.</li>
          <li>Conduct field surveys at two study sites in the Nepali plains.</li>
          <li>Conduct quantitative analysis of primary field survey data.</li>
          <li>Conduct quantitative analysis of of trends on climate variability and change on long-term climatic data.</li>
          <li>Assess the impacts on environmental change to local livelihood at study sites using socio-ecological resilience, and risk society framework.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My previsous research work involved climate change adaptation policy and environmental design.</p>
